# Code and data for "Enamel carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotopes reveal limited mobility in an extinct rhinoceros at Ashfall Fossil Beds, Nebraska, USA"

The code and data supplied here will reproduce the analyses and results published in:

Ward, C.T., Crowley, B.E., Secord, R. (2024)  at Ashfall Fossil Beds, Nebraska, USA. _Scientific Reports_ [insert doi upon final publication]

All novel and previously published isotopic data used in this study are provided in the "data" folder. 

We used calculators created by [Spzack et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.05.007) to calculate analytical uncertainty associated with stable isotope analyses. We have provided the excel calculator used in this publication ("uncertainty_Florida_SciRep"), and a blank version ("uncertainty_blank") for the reader in the "extra" folder. 

Questions about or issues with code or data can be send to ward1179@umn.edu or @ClarkDeadnDying on twitter.
